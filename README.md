How to run the project?
-After importing project, run it with config: spring-boot:run
Check it on address: localhost:8080

It's API for Android, so you don't have frontend.
http://localhost:8080/guest/restaurants should give you a list of restaurants in JSON format.

You should have installed MySql Workbench, and look into the configuration.properties file to setup database correctly.
